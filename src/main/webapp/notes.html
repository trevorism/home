Trends that will continue:

Computing space and processing power is growing exponentially. (Moore's Law)
Hardware and software is getting smaller but more distributed. (Microservices, blockchain)
Generic capabilities will be provided for, only niche software will need to be built. (Cloud)
Machine to machine interaction is dominating human to machine interaction. (Web APIs, Internet of Things)
Components are getting smarter (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning)
Companies are increasingly getting hacked (Equifax, Uber, etc.)

Therefore, in the future we must have:
Microscopic, intelligent, distributed, integrated, insecure computers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_fog

Today:
Stay on the leading edge. You do not want to be stuck on the low growth side of the exponential curve.
Write small, smart, robust services which can be discarded. Keep track of them all. Embrace the challenges of distribution.
Learn to leverage the cloud services.
Don't focus too heavily on GUIs, they are going away.
Become a AI practitioner.
Don't put all your sensitive data in one place. Segment and tokenize data.
